# Logistic regression
Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more input features. It is a type of regression analysis that is commonly used in machine learning for binary classification tasks. The algorithm models the relationship between the input features and the target variable by fitting a logistic function to the data.

Logistic regression can be applied when the target variable is binary, meaning it has only two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1). It is commonly used in a variety of applications such as credit scoring, fraud detection, and spam filtering. It is also often used in combination with other algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks to improve their performance on binary classification tasks.
