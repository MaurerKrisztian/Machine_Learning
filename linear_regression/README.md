# Linear regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value based on one or more input features. It is a simple yet powerful method that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. The algorithm models the linear relationship between the input features and the target variable by fitting a straight line to the data.
